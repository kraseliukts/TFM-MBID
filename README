Resume:
The public bike sharing service has shown an exponential development in recent decades, 
the service has spread in the territory of more than 90 countries, 
it is in constant technological development with the aim of providing the best service and experience to users. 
In addition, it is a sustainable transportation alternative, environmentally friendly, 
which contributes to the health of each user and to the fulfillment of the 17 SDGs (UN, 2015), 
in particular, to goal #11. In view of high demand for the service by citizens, 
it is important to conduct the study that helps to understand and determine the factors 
that predominate at the time of making decisions on the use of the service by users 
and to be able to predict the demand for the service.
This research work is focused on the development of the project-model that will serve as a guide 
for the development of future works, in which are described the following steps: data collection, 
pre-processing and analysis, determine the factors, including climatic and temporal factors, 
that have more influence on the user´s behavior, selecting and application of machine learning models of supervised learning
in order to make the short-term prediction with the best selected model. 

The proyect contains:
1. Python proyect than includes the data transformation, analysis, visualizations, application of machine learning models and final prediction.
2. R script with SARIMA analysis of time series.
3. Final data data.csv after all transformations, data_2024.csv file to make predictions and prediccion_2024.csv file with predicted values.
4. Survey data about SBP Quito system and Power BI proyect.
